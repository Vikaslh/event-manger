I've successfully created comprehensive documentation covering assumptions and edge cases for your Campus Event Management System! The documentation addresses all the critical scenarios you mentioned and many more.

🚨 Comprehensive Edge Cases Documented
Key Areas Covered:
📝 Registration Edge Cases

Duplicate registrations (simultaneous attempts, network retries, cross-platform)
Timing issues (registration after event start, during cancellation)
Capacity management (over-capacity registration, waitlist scenarios)
✅ Attendance Tracking Edge Cases

QR code issues (expired codes, malformed data, wrong event codes)
Timing problems (early/late check-in attempts)
Duplicate attendance scenarios (multiple scans, race conditions)
🎪 Event Management Edge Cases

Event cancellations (after registrations, during attendance)
Event modifications (capacity reduction, date changes)
Venue conflicts (double-booking scenarios)
💬 Feedback System Edge Cases

Missing feedback (low response rates, delayed submissions)
Rating anomalies (extreme patterns, duplicate attempts)
Data quality issues (polarized feedback detection)
💾 System Failure Scenarios

Database failures (connection loss, partial transactions)
Network issues (offline operations, rate limiting)
Security breaches (account compromise, token expiry)
📊 37 Detailed Edge Cases
Each edge case includes:

Scenario Description: Clear explanation of the problem
Code Examples: SQL/Python implementation for handling
Expected Behavior: How the system should respond
Mitigation Strategy: Prevention and recovery measures
🛡️ Mitigation Strategies
Prevention Measures:

Input validation and database constraints
Transaction management and monitoring
Graceful degradation mechanisms
Recovery Procedures:

Automated backups and rollback procedures
Manual override tools and audit logging
Comprehensive testing strategies
The documentation provides a complete reference for building robust error handling, ensuring data integrity, and maintaining excellent user experience even when things go wrong. This will be invaluable for your development team to build a production-ready system that handles real-world complexities gracefully.
