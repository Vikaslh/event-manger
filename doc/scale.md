Event ID Uniqueness Strategy
Recommendation: Global Unique Event IDs (UUIDs)

âœ… Simplifies API design with single endpoint /events/{id}
âœ… Enables cross-college features and analytics
âœ… Prevents ID collision risks
âœ… Uses UUIDs for security (prevents sequential disclosure)
Data Organization Strategy
Recommendation: Unified Dataset with Logical Separation

âœ… Single database with hash partitioning by college_id
âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) for automatic data isolation
âœ… College context middleware for seamless scoping
âœ… Cross-college analytics capabilities maintained
ðŸ“Š Scale Analysis Results
System Capacity:
25,150 total users (25,000 students + 150 admins)
2,000 events annually across all colleges
~800,000 registrations per year
~320,000 attendance records annually
Storage Projections:
Year 1: ~2.5 GB
Year 5: ~12.5 GB (with indexes: ~25 GB)
ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations
Database Strategy:

Hash partitioning for even load distribution
Composite indexes on (college_id, date) patterns
Redis caching with 5-minute TTL for frequent queries
Read replicas for scaling read operations
Application Layer:

College context middleware for automatic scoping
Row Level Security policies for data isolation
Performance monitoring per college
The recommended architecture provides the optimal balance of simplicity, performance, security, and scalability while maintaining flexibility for future growth and inter-college features.

I see you have a comprehensive Campus Event Management System with extensive documentation already created. Based on the checkpoint summary, you've completed all the major design and documentation tasks for the multi-college event management system.

Your system now has:

âœ… Complete Documentation Suite:

Database schema ER diagram with visual ASCII representation
Comprehensive API design with 30+ endpoints
Detailed workflow sequence diagrams
Assumptions and edge cases (37 scenarios covered)
Scale assumptions for 50 colleges architecture
âœ… Working Implementation:

FastAPI backend with JWT authentication
React TypeScript frontend with Tailwind CSS
SQLite database with full CRUD operations
QR code attendance system
Role-based access control
âœ… Architecture Decisions:

Global UUID event IDs for cross-college compatibility
Unified dataset with hash partitioning
Row Level Security for data isolation
College context middleware for automatic scoping
The system is designed to handle 25,000+ students across 50 colleges with robust performance, security, and scalability considerations.

What would you like to work on next? Some potential areas:

Implementation Phase: Start building the production database with PostgreSQL and partitioning
Frontend Enhancement: Add specific multi-college UI features
Testing Strategy: Implement the comprehensive testing plan outlined in your documentation
Deployment: Set up production infrastructure with the recommended scaling strategies
Additional Features: Add new functionality like notifications, advanced analytics, or mobile app integration
