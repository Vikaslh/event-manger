## Data Tracking Overview

### ðŸ“Š Key Data Points to Track

#### 1. ðŸŽª Event Creation Tracking
**Primary Table**: `events`
**Key Metrics**:
- **Event Details**: title, description, type, date, location, max_attendees
- **Organizational Data**: college_id, created_by (admin user)
- **Timestamps**: created_at, updated_at
- **Status Tracking**: Active events, capacity utilization

**Analytics to Track**:
```sql
-- Event creation trends by college
SELECT college_id, COUNT(*) as events_created, 
       DATE(created_at) as creation_date
FROM events 
GROUP BY college_id, DATE(created_at);

-- Popular event types
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count, AVG(max_attendees) as avg_capacity
FROM events 
GROUP BY type 
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Admin activity (event creation frequency)
SELECT created_by, COUNT(*) as events_created,
       MIN(created_at) as first_event,
       MAX(created_at) as latest_event
FROM events 
GROUP BY created_by;
```

#### 2. ðŸ‘¥ Student Registration Tracking
**Primary Table**: `registrations`
**Key Metrics**:
- **Registration Data**: student_id, event_id, created_at
- **User Information**: Via JOIN with users table (name, email, college)
- **Event Details**: Via JOIN with events table (title, date, type)

**Analytics to Track**:
```sql
-- Registration trends over time
SELECT DATE(created_at) as registration_date,
       COUNT(*) as daily_registrations
FROM registrations 
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY registration_date;

-- Most popular events (by registration count)
SELECT e.title, e.type, COUNT(r.id) as registration_count,
       e.max_attendees, 
       (COUNT(r.id) * 100.0 / e.max_attendees) as capacity_percentage
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON e.id = r.event_id
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY registration_count DESC;

-- Student engagement (registrations per student)
SELECT u.full_name, u.email, COUNT(r.id) as events_registered
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON u.id = r.student_id
WHERE u.role = 'student'
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY events_registered DESC;

-- College-wise registration statistics
SELECT c.name as college_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT r.student_id) as unique_students,
       COUNT(r.id) as total_registrations,
       COUNT(DISTINCT r.event_id) as events_with_registrations
FROM colleges c
JOIN users u ON c.id = u.college_id
JOIN registrations r ON u.id = r.student_id
GROUP BY c.id;
```

#### 3. âœ… Attendance Tracking
**Primary Table**: `attendance`
**Key Metrics**:
- **Attendance Data**: registration_id, student_id, event_id, check_in_time
- **QR Code Integration**: Real-time check-in timestamps
- **Attendance Rates**: Registered vs. Attended ratios

**Analytics to Track**:
```sql
-- Attendance rates by event
SELECT e.title, e.date,
       COUNT(DISTINCT r.id) as registered_count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as attended_count,
       (COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT r.id)) as attendance_rate
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON e.id = r.event_id
LEFT JOIN attendance a ON r.id = a.registration_id
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY attendance_rate DESC;

-- Peak check-in times
SELECT HOUR(check_in_time) as check_in_hour,
       COUNT(*) as check_ins
FROM attendance
GROUP BY HOUR(check_in_time)
ORDER BY check_in_hour;

-- Student attendance patterns
SELECT u.full_name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT r.id) as registered_events,
       COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as attended_events,
       (COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT r.id)) as attendance_percentage
FROM users u
JOIN registrations r ON u.id = r.student_id
LEFT JOIN attendance a ON r.id = a.registration_id
WHERE u.role = 'student'
GROUP BY u.id
HAVING registered_events > 0
ORDER BY attendance_percentage DESC;

-- Event type attendance analysis
SELECT e.type,
       COUNT(DISTINCT r.id) as total_registrations,
       COUNT(DISTINCT a.id) as total_attendance,
       AVG(CASE WHEN a.id IS NOT NULL THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as avg_attendance_rate
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN registrations r ON e.id = r.event_id
LEFT JOIN attendance a ON r.id = a.registration_id
GROUP BY e.type
ORDER BY avg_attendance_rate DESC;
```

#### 4. ðŸ’¬ Feedback Tracking
**Primary Table**: `feedback`
**Key Metrics**:
- **Feedback Data**: registration_id, student_id, event_id, rating, comment, created_at
- **Rating Analysis**: 1-5 scale ratings, average scores
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Comment text analysis (future enhancement)

**Analytics to Track**:
```sql
-- Event ratings and feedback summary
SELECT e.title, e.type,
       COUNT(f.id) as feedback_count,
       AVG(f.rating) as average_rating,
       MIN(f.rating) as min_rating,
       MAX(f.rating) as max_rating,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN f.comment IS NOT NULL AND f.comment != '' THEN 1 END) as comments_count
FROM events e
LEFT JOIN feedback f ON e.id = f.event_id
GROUP BY e.id
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;

-- Feedback trends over time
SELECT DATE(f.created_at) as feedback_date,
       COUNT(f.id) as feedback_count,
       AVG(f.rating) as daily_avg_rating
FROM feedback f
GROUP BY DATE(f.created_at)
ORDER BY feedback_date;

-- Rating distribution
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) as count,
       (COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM feedback)) as percentage
FROM feedback
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY rating;

-- Most engaged students (feedback providers)
SELECT u.full_name, u.email,
       COUNT(f.id) as feedback_given,
       AVG(f.rating) as avg_rating_given
FROM users u
JOIN feedback f ON u.id = f.student_id
GROUP BY u.id
ORDER BY feedback_given DESC;

-- College-wise satisfaction scores
SELECT c.name as college_name,
       COUNT(f.id) as total_feedback,
       AVG(f.rating) as avg_satisfaction_score,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN f.rating >= 4 THEN 1 END) as positive_feedback,
       (COUNT(CASE WHEN f.rating >= 4 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(f.id)) as satisfaction_percentage
FROM colleges c
JOIN events e ON c.id = e.college_id
JOIN feedback f ON e.id = f.event_id
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY avg_satisfaction_score DESC;
```
